# Indian_Election_Analysis-EDA
The "Indian Election Analysis" project encompasses a comprehensive study of election data, employing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and predictive modeling using the Random Forest algorithm.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The initial phase of the project focuses on EDA, where extensive analysis is conducted on the dataset to derive meaningful insights. This includes examining the demographic details of candidates, understanding the distribution of votes, and uncovering patterns related to factors such as age, gender, criminal records, and asset holdings. Visualizations, such as histograms, bar charts, and pie charts, are employed to make the data more interpretable. EDA provides a solid foundation for understanding the inherent characteristics of the election dataset.

Prediction Using Random Forest:
The predictive modeling phase utilizes the Random Forest Classifier, a robust algorithm capable of handling complex datasets and providing accurate predictions. The Random Forest algorithm constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
